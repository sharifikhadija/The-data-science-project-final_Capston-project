    "SpaceX has gained worldwide attention for a series of historic milestones. \n",

    "It is the only private company ever to return a spacecraft from low-earth orbit, which it first accomplished in December 2010.\n",

    "Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. \n",
